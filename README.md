# Azure Networking Lab Building Blocks

Nothing revolutionary here; just a bunch of reusable Azure cli scripts to quickly deploy and destroy some base constructs to enable you to focus your time on the interesting stuff

All building blocks 'stack' out of the box - that is, the pre-defined variables provided there will never be an overlap in naming or address space when connecting them together to form more complex topologies.
