# Azure Networking Lab Building Blocks

Firing up base constructs in Azure for lab test/poc/training purposes can be time consuming (and expensive if you don't deprov/destroy when you're not using them!)

These lab building blocks, specifically focussed around Azure networking, enable you quickly deploy and destroy some of these constructs to enable you to focus your time on the interesting stuff. All building blocks 'stack' out of the box - that is, if you use the pre-defined variables provided there will never be an overlap in naming or address space when connecting them together to form more complex topologies.

>DISCLAIMER: There's nothing revolutionary here; it's just a bunch of reusable Azure cli scripts, so it you're an experienced DevOps type with a mature automation strategy in place, this probably isn't for you! üòÅ
